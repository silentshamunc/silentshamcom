This will take some time and will install all packages necessary to run Victor Hugo and its tasks.

### :construction_worker: Development

While developing your website, use:

```bash
npm start
```

or for developing your website with `hugo server --buildDrafts --buildFuture`, use:

```bash
npm run build
```
