From [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1205912732882677760) of unanswered questions. 

#### Which party approached the other to settle?

#### What communications, if any, did UNC officials/lawyers have with UDC in the days immediately prior to UDC assigning their interest in Silent Sam to SCV?

#### Who, if anyone, conducted a review of state law and the UNC Policy Manual to confirm whether UGC had settlement powers at all?

#### What due diligence did UNC undertake in response to UDC’s request to take possession of the statue in August 2018 (with no additional demand for funds?)

#### What is the statutory meaning of "duly audited" in NCGS §143B-426.40A?

[Reference to NCGS §143B-426.40A in this tweet.](https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1205912732882677760)

#### Did anyone from the State Auditor's Office look "duly audit" the settlement at the time? (Possibly [@HampDellinger](https://twitter.com/HampDellinger) had mentioned this point)

#### Was a contemporaneous "warrant for payment of the claim" issued?

## The Timeline

#### What date did settlement negotiations begin?

#### If UNC initiated the settlement, who authorized it?

#### What date was a settlement-in-principle reached (agreement to turn over statue plus $2.5 million?)

#### Why did BOG Chairman Randy Ramsey sign the consent judgment on 11/22, before SVC even had colorable title to Silent Sam?

#### Why did Ramsey and Bill Roper both sign the consent judgment before University Governance had an opportunity to meet to "approve" the proposal?

#### Prior to engaging in settlement negotiations, what background investigation / due dilligence was done on the SCV, the UDC, the legal claims alleged, and whether the SCV had even colorable title to the monument?

## The Payout

#### What was the basis for arriving at the $2.5 million figure?

The most disturbing possibility, suggested by
[Dawn Vaughn](https://twitter.com/dawnbvaughan) on the
December 5 Under the Dome podcast, is that it may have been a response
to the North Carolina General Assembly's allocation of $2.5 million
dollars for a
[monument to African Americans at the State Capitol](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article232254627.html)
([source](https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1204216287917944832)).

Currently, this is mostly just speculation, but like,
[they really might be that dumb](https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1204433603943383040).
