title: "Kevin Stone"

Current leader of the [NC Sons of Confederate Veterans](/tags/ncscv/). Author of the
[victory letter](/tags/victoryletter/) that, for several reasons,
poured gasoline on the Silent Sham controversy.
One reason was because, in the letter, Stone's expressed
intent to use the $2.5 million dollar [monument trust](/tags/trust/)
to build a meeting facility for the SCV.
Another reason was that when [T. Greg Doucette](/tags/tgd/) posted the letter,
Stone [shut down Doucette's Dropbox with a DMCA complaint](/cases/dmca/),
which in retrospect was almost certainly a misstep from both strategic
and legal perspectives.

Stone is active in the so-called "[Mechanized Calvary](/tags/vroom/)."
