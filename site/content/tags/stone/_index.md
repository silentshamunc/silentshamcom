Current leader of the [NC Sons of Confederate Veterans](/tags/ncscv/). Author of the
[victory letter](/tags/victoryletter/) that poured gasoline on the Silent Sham controversy,
in part because of Stone's expressed
intent to use the $2.5 million dollar [monument trust](/tags/trust/)
to build a meeting facility for the SCV.
Very active in the so-called "[Mechanized Calvary](/tags/vroom/)."
