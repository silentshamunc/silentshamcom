The "Sons of Confederate Veterans Mechanized Cavalry" or "Mechanized Cavalry Heritage Defense." The group is lead by the self-styled "commander" of the [North Carolina Sons of Confederate Veterans](/tags/ncscv/), [Kevin Stone](/tags/stone/). It's slogan is "[Ride As You Would With Forrest](https://web.archive.org/web/20190917123950/http://www.csascvmc.org/)," a reference to Nathan Bedford Forrest, the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

As reported by the Daily Tar Heel, [Stone's leadership in the Mechanized Calvary is a source of tension within the NC SCV](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2019/12/confederate-internal-conflict).
