title: DMCA ยง512(f) Counter-suit
---

Shortly after the [sham settlement](/cases/shamsettlement),
Greg Doucette posted a letter sent to members of the
North Carolina Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) to his Dropbox account.
Members of the SCV misused the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
claiming that Mr. Doucette was violating their copyright by
posting the letter they wrote.

This is a misuse of the DMCA, and Mr. Doucette threatened, and ultimately
filed, a lawsuit against the SCV in California for the harm they caused
him through their misuse of the DMCA.
