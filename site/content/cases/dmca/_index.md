title: DMCA ยง512(f) Counter-suit
---

Also known as **Thomas Gregory Doucette and the Law Offices of T. Greg
Doucette PLLC v Ronald Kevin Stone, the North Carolina Division Sons
of Confederate Veterans Inc., and Dropbox Inc.**,
[4:19-cv-08148 (NDCA)](https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1205635421050429442).

Shortly after the [sham settlement](/cases/shamsettlement),
T. Greg Doucette posted to his Dropbox account an email sent to 
members of the North Carolina Division Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV)
by R. Kevin Stone, the group's "Commander". Stone, either personally or
through an attorney, misused the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
to submit a takedown notice to Dropbox, claiming that Mr. Doucette was
violating SCV's copyright by posting the email and getting Dropbox to
disable file sharing on Mr. Doucette's account for two weeks.

This was a misuse of the DMCA. Mr. Doucette threatened, and ultimately
filed, a lawsuit against the SCV under ยง512(f) of the DMCA in California
for the harm they caused through their abuse of the DMCA takedown process.
