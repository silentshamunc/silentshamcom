The Daily Tar Heel, the independent student newspaper at UNC Chapel Hill,
filed a lawsuit against the UNC system Board of Governors and the members 
who wrote the editorial confessing to the $74,999 "extra" settlement with
the SCV.

The DTH lawsuit asks the Court to find that the Board violated the North
Carolina Open Meetings Act, and to void the [Silent Sham](/cases/shamsettlement) as a result of
the violation.
