Rucho**, [20 CVS 22 (Orange County)](https://twitter.com/greg_doucette/status/1214922285326487558).

The Daily Tar Heel, the independent student newspaper at UNC Chapel Hill,
filed a lawsuit against the UNC system Board of Governors as well as the 
individual Board members who wrote [the foolish editorial](/tags/loloped) 
confessing to the $74,999 "extra" settlement with the SCV and other crimes.

The DTH lawsuit asks the Court to find that the Board violated the North
Carolina Open Meetings Act during the secret negotiations over the 
[Silent Sham](/cases/shamsettlement), and to void the settlements as a 
punishment for violating the law.
